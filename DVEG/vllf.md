### ✅ Given:

* Each **mound** has dimensions:

  * **Base:** 3 meters × 4 meters
  * **Height (to top):** 1.5 meters
* Number of mounds inside the triangle (from previous answer): **140 mounds**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Mound

Assuming each mound is a **pyramid or conical-like shape** (since it "goes to the top"), we’ll estimate its volume using the formula for a **pyramid**:

$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
$$

* Base Area = 3 × 4 = **12 m²**
* Height = **1.5 m**

$$
V_{\text{mound}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \times 1.5 = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \text{ m}^3
$$

---

### Step 2: Multiply by Total Mounds

$$
V_{\text{total}} = 6 \, \text{m}^3 \times 140 = \boxed{840 \, \text{m}^3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **Total Volume = 840 m³**
